# Biometric Authentication Implementation

This document provides instructions for implementing biometric authentication in the application.

## Overview

The biometric authentication system uses the WebAuthn API to provide secure, passwordless authentication using biometric devices (fingerprint, face recognition, etc.).

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation consists of:

1. **BiometricLogin Component**: A standalone component for biometric login
2. **Dashboard Component**: A simple dashboard that users are redirected to after successful login
3. **Route Configuration**: Routes for the biometric login and dashboard pages

## Backend Requirements

The backend needs to implement the following endpoints:

1. **Start Verification**: `/biometric/verify/start`
   - Accepts: `{ email: string }`
   - Returns: WebAuthn authentication options including challenge

2. **Finish Verification**: `/biometric/verify/finish`
   - Accepts: `{ email: string, assertionResponse: object }`
   - Returns: Verification result

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install Required Packages

```bash
npm install base64url
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file includes:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-api-url
```

### 3. Backend Implementation

The backend should:

1. Generate authentication options with a challenge
2. Store the challenge for later verification
3. Verify the assertion response against the stored challenge
4. Update the user's authentication status

### 4. Testing

To test the biometric login:

1. Navigate to `/biometric-login`
2. Enter your email
3. Follow the browser's prompts to authenticate with your biometric device
4. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to resolve import 'base64url'"**: Make sure you've installed the package with `npm install base64url`
- **"API endpoint not found"**: Ensure your backend has implemented the required endpoints
- **"Device authentication failed"**: Check that your device supports WebAuthn and has biometric capabilities

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper session management
- Consider rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Store credentials securely using appropriate encryption
